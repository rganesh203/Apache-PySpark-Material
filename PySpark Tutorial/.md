🔥 What is Apache Spark?

          Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed big data processing framework built for speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics. Originally developed at UC Berkeley’s AMPLab, it is now a top-level project of the Apache Software Foundation.

Apache Spark is an open-source distributed computing system that provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. It's designed to be fast and general-purpose, enabling a wide range of applications to run faster and at scale.

✅ Key Features of Apache Spark:

          Feature	                           Description
          In-Memory Computation	Stores intermediate data in memory (RAM) instead of writing to disk, leading to much faster performance compared to Hadoop.
          Distributed Processing	Works with multiple nodes in a cluster to handle large-scale data across machines.
          Fault Tolerance	          Automatically handles node failures using lineage graphs and resilient distributed datasets (RDDs).
          Multi-Language Support	APIs available in Scala (native), Java, Python (PySpark), R, and SQL.
          Unified Engine	          Supports batch processing, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing in one engine.
          Speed:                        Spark can run programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk.

PySpark:

          PySpark is the Python API for Spark, which allows developers to harness the simplicity of Python and the power of Apache Spark to scale up their data processing applications. It exposes the Spark programming model to Python through a simple, efficient API built on top of Spark's Java API.

Key Differences between Apache Spark and PySpark:

          Language: Apache Spark provides APIs in multiple languages like Scala, Java, Python, and R, whereas PySpark specifically caters to Python developers.
          
          Ease of Use: PySpark is particularly popular among Python developers due to its ease of use and integration with Python's rich ecosystem of libraries.
          
          Performance: Both Apache Spark and PySpark offer similar performance characteristics, but the choice of language might affect performance slightly due to language-specific optimizations.
          
          Flexibility: While Apache Spark offers a wider range of language support, PySpark is optimized for Python-centric workflows, making it easier to integrate with Python-based tools and libraries.

🏗️ Apache Spark Architecture

          Driver Program – The main application that defines transformations and actions.
          
          Cluster Manager – Allocates resources (YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes, or Spark’s own Standalone).
          
          Executors – Run on worker nodes and execute tasks assigned by the driver.
          
          Tasks – Units of work sent to executors by the driver.

📊 Core Components:

          Component	Description
          Spark Core	Base engine providing memory management, fault recovery, task scheduling, etc.
          Spark SQL	SQL interface to process structured data.
          Spark Streaming	Real-time data processing (micro-batches).
          MLlib	Machine learning library for Spark.
          GraphX	Library for graph and network computation.

🐍 What is PySpark?

          PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, enabling Python developers to write Spark applications using Python instead of Scala or Java. PySpark wraps the Spark engine using Py4J, allowing Python code to interface with the JVM-based Spark runtime.

🔧 Features of PySpark:

          Native integration with Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
          Allows using Spark SQL, DataFrames, and RDDs in Python.         
          Enables large-scale data transformations, ETL pipelines, data analytics, and machine learning using Python.

🔁 Apache Spark vs PySpark — Comparison Table
          Feature	Apache Spark (Core)	PySpark
          Language	Primarily written in Scala (also supports Java, R, SQL)	Python
          Target Users	Scala/Java developers	Python developers / Data Scientists
          Ease of Use	Moderate (strong typing, verbose syntax)	High (Python is more readable and intuitive)
          Performance	Slightly faster due to native language (Scala)	Slightly slower (uses Py4J to connect to JVM)
          Data Science Integration	Needs external tools	Seamlessly integrates with Python data science tools
          Use Case	Backend systems, enterprise-scale pipelines	Data analysis, prototyping, ML workflows

📌 When to Use PySpark?

          When you're a Python developer and want to leverage Spark’s distributed power.       
          When building ETL pipelines using Python.
          When using pandas becomes too slow or memory-bound for large data.
          When integrating Spark into machine learning workflows using tools like scikit-learn, MLlib, or TensorFlow.

💡 PySpark Code Example:

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark session

          spark = SparkSession.builder \
              .appName("PySpark Example") \
              .getOrCreate()

# Create DataFrame

          data = [("Alice", 25), ("Bob", 30), ("Cathy", 27)]
          df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Name", "Age"])

# Filter and show results

df.filter(df.Age > 26).display()
